This is the Critical Edition of the Mahābhārata curated by Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute, Pune.   
The Mahābhārata states that it contains 1,00,000 verses.   
The BORI Critical Edition contains about 85,000.    
Each line of each verse is tagged by a key of the form: 01225019c    
The methodology and explanation of these tag by which every line of the text can be uniquely identified is given here: https://bombay.indology.info/mahabharata/text/UD/MBh00.txt

The text is divided into eighteen files, one per main book (पर्वन्) of the
Mahabharata. However, the format of each line is such as to identify it
uniquely, whichever file it happens to come from. At the start of every line
appears a nine-character line-number specifying the book or पर्वन् (two
digits), the chapter or अध्याय (three digits), the verse or श्लोक (three
digits), and the quarter-verse or पाद (one letter, specifying the first of
the two पादs that form each line). Thus the first line of the Gita appears
as:  

06023001a धर्मक्षेत्रे कुरुक्षेत्रे समवेता युयुत्सवः

indicating that it represents पादs a and b of the first verse of book 6,
chapter 23.

If the line is part of a verse in त्रिष्टुभ् or other longer metre, the
division between the पादs is marked with a semicolon:

01001065a दुर्योधनो मन्युमयो महाद्रुमः; स्कन्धः कर्णः शकुनिस्तस्य शाखाः

If the line is part of a passage in prose, the final letter of the line-number
(which normally indicates the पाद) is capitalised:

01003001A जनमेजयः पारिक्षितः सह भ्रातृभिः कुरुक्षेत्रे दीर्घसत्रमुपास्ते

If the line is a header such as जनमेजय उवाच, the final letter of the
line-number is replaced by a space:

01045003  जनमेजय उवाच
